# Pizza-Rating-Prediction-with-R
The purpose of this project is to perform data analysis, to predict the review scores for individual pizza restaurants, to find out the relationship between restaurant locations and price ranges and to forecast the price levels of the restaurants. To figure out the answers to these questions can help pizza restaurants improve the customersâ€™ satisfaction in order to have more business.
I used R to perform data analysis and visualization to explore and identify the characters in the three datasets, and uncover insights to understand how the location affects the price and customers reviews through the following steps:
1.	Load Required Packages
2.	Clean Up and Prepare Data for Analysis
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis
4.	Data Visualization
5.	Summary of Findings

In the analysis, the main algorithms that I used are nonlinear multivariant regression for review score prediction and random forecast classification for price level prediction. The result of regression is the predicted value of review scores so that the restaurant can improve the service according to the critical predictors. The result of classification is the predicted group of price level the restaurant may belong to. It can help the restaurant re-adjust their prices
